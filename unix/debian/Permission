d | rwx | r-x | r-x 
d = directory

r: readable
w: writable
x: executable (basically an executable program)
-: empty

Examples:
chmod u+x myfile
chmod u-x myfile
chmod ug+w myfile

The numerical representations are seen below:
4: read permission
2: write permission
1: execute permission

Example:
chmod 755 myfile

7 = 4 + 2 + 1, so 7 is the user permissions and it has read, write and execute permissions
5 = 4 + 1, the group has read and execute permissions
5 = 4 +1, and all other users have read and execute permissions

chown
chgrp
